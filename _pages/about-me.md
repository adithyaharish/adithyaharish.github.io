I take this page as a chance to talk about myself — not as a software engineer.

With the advent of AI, the role of a Software Engineer is changing fast. Back in 2022, when I was at Fidelity, there were no coding assistants like ChatGPT. We relied on Stack Overflow, GeeksforGeeks, documentation, or endless surfing to debug issues. I still remember spending six months building an end-to-end dashboard during my internship.

Fast forward three years to my recent role at Marriott, I built a similar application in just two weeks. What changed? The coding assistant. No more hours lost searching endlessly — just ask AI and get instant guidance. With this pace of change, who knows if the SDE role will even exist in five years? What I do know is that we must adapt and take control of the changes, not resist them.

But life is not just about work or academics. Sports have always been my stress reliever. Hand me a bat and ball and I’ll never get tired of cricket. Badminton is another favorite — I could play for hours. I also keep myself updated with movies and series, and I’ll happily argue why Breaking Bad is the greatest show ever made.

As the saying goes, “No one has ever become poor by giving.” I believe in contributing back to society, and while I’ve taken small steps to support those in need, I hope to do much more in the future.

Feel free to reach out for a chat, a query, or a collaboration. Until then — spread peace!
