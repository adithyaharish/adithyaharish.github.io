Previously, a software developer at Hansen Technologies, where I worked on developing and configuring an operations support system (OSS) for telecommunications service providers.  
For the summer of 2023, I joined Hansen again on a contract basis and contributed toward streamlining the training process for new hires. By creating well-structured training modules and comprehensive documentation, I helped reduce the onboarding time so that new team members could quickly start contributing to the project.  

Please feel free to visit other sections of this site to know more about me!
