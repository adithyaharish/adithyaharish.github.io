I'm a software engineer who loves transforming ideas into user-friendly products. Over the course of my work, I've learned that writing code is only part of the story — what excites me just as much is understanding why the software matters, how it helps the business, and how people actually use it.

I value collaboration and thrive when working with cross-functional teams, where diverse perspectives shape better products.

## What I Do
**Software Development** – Building reliable, high-performance systems, scalable APIs, and full-stack applications    
**AI & ML** – Exploring intelligent solutions that simplify complex workflows and enhance user experience    
**Systems Thinking** – Designing and architecting systems that are reliable, scalable, and maintainable
