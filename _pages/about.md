I am a software developer at Hansen Technologies, where I develop and configure an operations support system (OSS) for telecommunications service providers. My tasks include developing adapters in Java, that can communicate with the legacy and the latest components through APIs to enable service provisioning. I learned to develop a robust and scalable product by containerizing it with Docker, managing multiple containers with Kubernetes, scaling them with multiple nodes, triggering a build with Jenkins and finally deploying the product on the cloud with Amazon Web Services (AWS).
